# Exercise
#  1. create a function that takes a number as an argument, and check if this number is even or odd
# 2. create a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument, and check if each number is even or odd



# def even_odd (num) :
#     if num % 2 == 0:
#        print(f"{num} is even") 
#     elif num % 2 != 0:
#         print(f"{num} is odd")
        
# even_odd()




# def evenodd_list (num_list) :
#     for num in num_list:
#         if num % 2 == 0:
#          print(f"{num} is even") 
#         elif num % 2 != 0:
#             print(f"{num} is odd")
            
# evenodd_list([3, 8, 4, 2])
